    title: XCDAS: The Evolution of a Standards-Based Library Repository System at Dartmouth
    authors: Anthony Helm
    conference: Presentation, Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) Spring 2017
    details: "The Dartmouth College Library has been working with digital objects in its collections for several years and currently maintains a variety of vended, open source, and locally developed solutions to manage and deliver these objects to the local and global online research community. In 2011, following the creation of “The Dartmouth Digital Library Program Plan” and with work underway on the NEH-funded project to create a Scholarly Digital Edition of the papers of Samson Occom, the Library began to coalesce its development strategy around a stack of predominantly open source software already being used to manage XML documents since the early 2000s, rather than to pursue the emerging Hydra technology stack. The result is XCDAS (XML Collections and Digital Archive Storage), an ever-evolving set of tools to manage TEI text collections, e-books, maps, posters, and manuscripts. The current system is managing over 200K bagged objects, over 200K derivative files, and 1500 XML documents. This presentation gives an overview of the technical infrastructure and of the system itself, which includes tools for working with master file packages, generating derivative files, performing archive validation and consistency checking, converting simplified markup to TEI, and for publishing web sites via XSL transformations."  - paper:
