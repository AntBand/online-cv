  degree: Certificate, Library Leadership in a Digital Age
  university: Harvard University Graduate School of Education
  time: 2013
  details: "Digital technology is transforming the ways libraries must function to promote learning, advance knowledge and provide access to important information resources. These changes, in turn, have compelled library leaders to reevaluate their organization’s core goals, structure and purposes. Leaders must ask fundamental and unprecedented questions of practice—of themselves, their organizations and their constituents. Library Leadership in a Digital Age brings together faculty experts, policy makers and library leaders to consider the current state and future direction of the profession. During the program participants identify fundamental changes occurring in the field of education and consider their implications for libraries, information services, and library leaders. In addition, participants examine new research on how people learn in a digital age and how new technologies are redefining the teaching/learning process."
